<h2 align="center">Example Investigation Narrative</h2>

An analyst opens a high-risk refund approval and sees that the refund was approved in two minutes, had no evidence, used a manual override, and refunded almost the full order amount. The same support agent also has an unusually high approval rate and has repeatedly approved refunds for the same customer.
